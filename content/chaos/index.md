I have been an avid *Game of Thrones* fan since the show debuted on HBO. One of my favourite characters on the show was Peter Baelish *a.k.a* Littlefinger played by the brilliat Aiden Gillen. There is a very famous dialogue of Littlefinger in Season 3 of the series:
> Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder.
I have never related to anything more than this dialogue ever in my life. As I look back I can safely say that my life has been one big circus of chaos. Growing up in my adolescent years, I had definite plan of things I wanted to achieve in life by the time I was 25. But *boy* the 14 year old Ashish was wrong.
